      <br>
      <p1> After working in multiple facets of I.T. for almost twenty years, I have decided to shift beyond being a “supporter of creators” to become a creator myself. For these nearly two decades, I have stood in awe of what development teams are able to accomplish when they have business goals coupled with a desire to improve people’s lives through the products they create. </p1>
        <br>
        <p2> I have supported products and provided troubleshooting (help desk), gathered and documented how systems were intended to work before and as they were built (business analysis), coached and guided teams to use better practices through self observation and incremental improvement (scrum master), and coached other scrum masters to help their teams grow and perform at their best given their unique needs and challenges (agile coach). All of these experiences and perspectives have prepared me to take the plunge into building amazing products that will ultimately improve lives. I embrace the never ending journey of learning that is software engineering.</p2>
